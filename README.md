Basic-HTTP-server
How to Do It (Step by Step) Use req.url → This gives the URL the user visits (like /write or /read). Check with if...else → Decide which code should run for each route. Write or Read file using fs → Only when the correct route is visited.

How It Works

Visit http://localhost:3000/ → Shows a welcome message. Visit http://localhost:3000/write → Creates example.txt with some text. Visit http://localhost:3000/read → Reads and shows file content. Visit any other URL → Shows 404 Not Found.
